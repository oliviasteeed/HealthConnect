            <h2>Beginning with understanding</h2>
            <p>HealthConnect’s development began by interviewing seniors above the age of 75 that lived independent
                of
                external care to understand opinions and relationships with technology. The team sought to
                understand
                and empathize with the intended users of the app with a desire to help.

                    <p>Interviews centered around challenges in seniors’ lives and technology

                        features were necessary. Original plans for HealthConnect included symptom tracking and
                        community
                        sharing. Symptom tracking would facilitate seniors to create a pool of data, which would be
                        summarized into easily readable charts for physicians to overview during appointments, instead
                        of
                        relying only on patient memory for symptom information. Community sharing would reduce the
                        isolation
                        that chronic health conditions and retirement can impose and allow seniors to share coping

                app tasks followed by an interview to gain insight into their understanding and experience. We
                tested remotely and in-person to get a diverse pool of testers. Key goals of testing were usability
                targets based on Nielsen’s 5 components of usability <a

                appealed to people and would be used. Testing results revealed that many tasks were difficult and
                unnatural to users, and that the purpose
                of the app was unclear, leading to lack of interest. These were important insights that would have
