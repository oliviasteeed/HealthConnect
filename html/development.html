                <h2>Beginning with understanding</h2>
                <p>HealthConnect’s development began by interviewing seniors above the age of 75 that lived independent
                    of
                    external care to understand opinions and relationships with technology. The team sought to
                    understand
                    and empathize with the intended users of the app with a desire to help.

                <h3>Identifying challenges</h3>
                <p>Interviews centered around challenges in seniors’ lives and technology usage. We found challenges
                    could be grouped into categories of physical and accessibility and technology use and understanding.

                <p>All interviewees had chronic health conditions that impaired physical capabilities in varying
                    degrees. This was important, as it suggested that seniors frequently are thinking about their health
                    due to conditions.</p>

                <p>Seniors used technology to obtain new information as they reported lacking exposure to many others,
                    so depended on the internet. Interviewees also noted anxiety over trusting online information and
                    struggles deducing what is reputable.

                <h5>Health management</h5>
                <p>Many interviewees were already comfortable integrating technology into their healthcare activities
                    and cited health tracking apps as their most used.</p>

                <h2>Concept development</h2>
                <p>Our secondary research confirmed that seniors feel empowered when they can manage their health
                    through health-related technologies, yet they want more detailed and personalized information about
                    disease and medication specifics <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30974780/">(1)</a>. We
                    created three app concepts focused on promoting independent living and health, but pursued the one
                    centralizing health data due to its mapping to user research and large estimated benefits to the
                    target audience of seniors aging in place.

                    features were necessary. Original plans for HealthConnect included symptom tracking and community
                    sharing. Symptom tracking would facilitate seniors to create a pool of data, which would be
                    summarized into easily readable charts for physicians to overview during appointments, instead of
                    relying only on patient memory for symptom information. Community sharing would reduce the isolation
                    that chronic health conditions and retirement can impose and allow seniors to share coping
                    strategies.</p>

                    added later in future updates, but it was critical that the principal functions were smooth and
                    usable to ensure the app satisfied user and developer goals.</p>

                    official health records. This led to two account creation options that allow automatic health data

                    app tasks followed by an interview to gain insight into their understanding and experience. We
                    tested remotely and in-person to get a diverse pool of testers. Key goals of testing were usability

                    of the app was unclear, leading to lack of interest. These were important insights that would have
                    gone unnoticed without testing.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section-wrapper">
                <h4>Usability insights</h4>
                <p>The usability testing and interview transcripts were condensed into four key insights that informed a
                    redesign and reconceptualization of HealthConnect.</p>

                <h5>Revealing options</h5>
                <p>Participants struggled to use app functions hidden by navigation, as older testers especially did not
                    explore the interface independently. This would lead users to not use all app features. We addressed
                    this by making options visible without additional interaction.</p>

                <h5>Explaining app purpose</h5>
                <p>Until participants understood the app purpose, they were confused and did not find it valuable.
                    Additionally, a lack of explanation for their actions led to confusion and misunderstanding. We
                    addressed this issues by including supplementary copy throughout the app and creating an onboarding
                    tutorial to familiarize users with main features.</p>

                <h5>Content hierarchy</h5>
                <p>Initial condition and medication content was overwhelming to users and lacked relevance as
                    introductory information was organized with highest priority. Participants appreciated having
                    reputable information on hand, but restructuring condition and medication content based on usage
                    would allow users to quickly access what they need.</p>

                <h5>Assistive interface</h5>
                <p>Navigation and interaction was impaired by the lack of clear hierarchy and interaction points.
                    Additionally, the focus on text entry led to input errors which could be problematic. To remedy this
                    we redesigned the interface to assist user interaction and understanding using contrasting elements
                    to create visual hierarchy and assistive inputs when possible.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section-wrapper">
                <h4>Additional insights</h4>
                <p>In addition to usability findings, interviews helped us understand the mental models and attitudes of
                    potential users. This allowed us to confirm the validity of the app, and focus on what was important
                    to keep and improve.</p>

                <h5>Revealing options</h5>
                <p>Participants struggled to use app functions hidden by navigation, as older testers especially did not
                    explore the interface independently. This would lead users to not use all app features. We addressed
                    this by making options visible without additional interaction.</p>

                <h5>Positive reception</h5>
                <p>After explanation of the app purpose and use context, interviewees expressed approval for the app
                    concept and the convenience it offered. Seniors notes interest in the app relieving them from
                    remembering appointment details, medication dosage and future appointments themselves, as well as
                    the added context it provided.</p>

                <figure>
                    <blockquote>

                            data. It would be very convenient.”</p>

                </figure>

                <h5>Self Judgement</h5>
                <p>Secondary research often stated that seniors blame themselves for lack of understanding of new
                    technologies <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30974780/">(1)</a> and this was confirmed in
                    testing. Despite being told the prototype was a first draft and any issues they had reflected its
                    lack of finish, not their abilities, they still blamed themselves for lack of technological
                    literacy. This highlighted the need for seniors to understand the app so they do not feel bad about
                    themselves during use, which was addressed with an onboarding process explaining main app features.
