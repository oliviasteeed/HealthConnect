                <h2>A healthcare gap</h2>
                <p>When elderly patients understand their conditions, medications and prognosis, they experience better
                    health outcomes and reduced anxiety, yet unfortunately many do not have this luxury. Healthcare
                    providers are the primary source of health information for many seniors, with interactions providing
                    comfort, but not all patients receive the support they need, and report anxiety and stress because
                    of it
                    <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1189-9">(1)</a> <a
                        href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34738913/">(2)</a>. Elderly patients need another way to
                    access reputable health information, and visualize their health profile to empower them to manage
                    their
                    health and remain independent.

            <p>Most seniors want to age in place, as this allows a greater sense of autonomy and increases physical and
