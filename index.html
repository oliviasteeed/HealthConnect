            <h2>A healthcare gap</h2>
            <p class="bottom-margin-small">When elderly patients understand their conditions, medications and prognosis,
                they experience better
                health outcomes and reduced anxiety, yet unfortunately many do not have this luxury. Healthcare
                providers are the primary source of health information for many seniors, with interactions providing
                comfort, but not all patients receive the support they need, and report anxiety and stress because
                of it
                <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1189-9">(1)</a> <a
                    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34738913/">(2)</a>. Elderly patients need another way to
                access reputable health information, and visualize their health profile to empower them to manage
                their
                health and remain independent.

            <h3>Remaining independent</h3>
            <p>Most seniors want to age in place, as this allows a greater sense of autonomy and increases physical and
                mental well-being <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30974780/">(3)</a>. The desire to remain
                independent, even when health made it difficult, means seniors are adding health tracking and
                maintenance technologies to their condition management plans <a
